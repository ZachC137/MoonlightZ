## About v2!

### Why a rewrite?

Moonlight v1 was designed with a specific free hosting project in mind, which limited its features and left many user-requested functionalities missing.

### What will v2 offer compared to v1?

> - Complete UI redesign
> - A modular feature system to enable and disable features
> - A plugin system to modify existing features in terms of their behavior and UI
> - Customizable theming that lets you style Moonlight exactly how you want
> - Improved error handling
> - A diagnostic system to quickly identify and resolve issues faster
> - Modular authentication system and a lot more!

### When will v2 release?
> We are currently changing our application architecture from a completly server side blazor application to a wasm frontend and an asp.net api server as the backend. This change provides an REST api for developers wanting to integrate moonlight into parts of their applications and allows to scale moonlight horizontally. This will take some time to reach the state of the current v2 branch so please be patient :)
