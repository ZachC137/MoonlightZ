## About v2!

### Why a rewrite?

Moonlight v1 was designed with a specific free hosting project in mind, which limited its features and left many user-requested functionalities missing.

### What will v2 offer compared to v1?

> - Complete UI redesign
> - A modular feature system to enable and disable features
> - A plugin system to modify existing features in terms of their behavior and UI
> - Customizable theming that lets you style Moonlight exactly how you want
> - Improved error handling
> - A diagnostic system to quickly identify and resolve issues faster
> - Modular authentication system and a lot more!

### When will v2 release?

Moonlight v2 will release in the following stages:
> 1. Beta Releases (starting in April)
> 2. Bug fixing of reported beta bugs
> 3. Release of the first stable and fully supported version of Moonlight v2
> 4. Implementing more features which can be downloaded and enabled if you want to do so

> [!NOTE]
